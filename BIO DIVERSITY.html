  <h1 class="H">What is Bio Diversity?</h1>
  <p2>
   Biodiversity describes the richness and variety of life on earth. It is the most complex and important feature of our planet. Without biodiversity, life would not sustain.
  </p2><br>
  
  <p>
   The term biodiversity was coined in 1985. It is important in natural as well as artificial ecosystems. It deals with natureâ€™s variety, the biosphere. It refers to variabilities among plants, animals, and microorganism species.
  </p><br>
  
  <p>
   Biodiversity includes the number of different organisms and their relative frequencies in an ecosystem. It also reflects the organization of organisms at different levels.
  </p><br>
  
  <p>
     Biodiversity holds ecological and economic significance. It provides us with nourishment, housing, fuel, clothing, and several other resources. It also extracts monetary benefits through tourism. Therefore, it is very important to have a good knowledge of biodiversity for a sustainable livelihood.
  </p><br>
  
  <h2 class="v">What is Biodiversity Conservation</h2>
  <p>
     The variability of life on Earth is called Biodiversity. Biodiversity takes into account all the living organisms present on Earth. Healthy and good biodiversity indicate a healthy and good ecosystem. Hence, biodiversity is very important. A healthy ecosystem also includes the availability of pure water, pure air, healthy land, a good climate, and the availability of nutrients on Earth. Therefore, biodiversity conservation plays an important role in the quality of life of all living organisms.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="v">Conservation of Biodiversity</h2>
  <p2>
     Biodiversity conservation refers to the protection, preservation, and management of ecosystems and natural habitats and ensuring that they are healthy and functional.
  </p2>
  
 
  <h2 class="v">The three main objectives of Biodiversity Conservation are as follows:</h2> 
    <li> To protect and preserve species diversity.</li>
    <li> To ensure sustainable management of the species and ecosystems.</li>
    <li> Prevention and restoration of ecological processes and life support systems.</li>
