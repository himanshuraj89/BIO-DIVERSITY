    <h1>METHOD OF CONSERVATION </h1>
    <H2 class="b">Biodiversity and its Conservation Methods</H2>
    <p >Biodiversity refers to the variability of life on earth. It can be conserved in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>In-situ Conservation</li><BR>
       <li> Ex-situ Conservation</li></ul></p>
     <div class="c">  <H2 class="b">IN-SITU CONSERVATION</H2>
       <P1>
        In-situ conservation of biodiversity is the conservation of species within their natural habitat.<BR> In this method, the natural ecosystem is maintained and protected.<BR>
        
        The in-situ conservation has several advantages. Following are the important advantages of in-situ conservation:<BR>
       <OL> 
        <LI>It is a cost-effective and convenient method of conserving biodiversity.</LI><BR>
        <LI>A large number of living organisms can be conserved simultaneously.</LI><BR>
       <LI> Since the organisms are in a natural ecosystem, they can evolve better and can easily adjust to different environmental conditions.</LI><BR></OL></P1></div>
        Certain protected areas where in-situ conservation takes place include national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves.<BR>
       <UL><LI class="b"> <B>National Parks</B><BR></LI>
       <div class="d"> These are limited reserves maintained by the government for the conservation of wildlife as well as the environment. Human activities are prohibited in national parks and they are solely dedicated to the protection of natural fauna of the area. They mostly occupy an area of 100-500 square km. There are a total of 104 national parks in India, right now.<br> The national parks may even be within a biosphere reserve. These are small reserves that are protected and maintained by the government. Its boundaries are well protected,<br> where human activities such as grazing, forestry, habitat, and cultivation are restricted. <br></div>


       <b>Example-</b> Kanha National Park, Gir National Park, Kaziranga National Park, and so on.

            <img src="image/WhatsApp Image 2023-11-16 at 1.18.47 PM (1).jpeg" alt="image"/>
    <div > <B><LI class="b"> Wildlife Sanctuaries</B></LI><BR>
      <div class="d"> Wildlife Sanctuaries are protected areas meant only for the conservation of wild animals. A few human activities such as cultivation, wood collection, and other forest product collection are allowed here, but they must not interfere with the conservation of the animals. Tourist visits are also allowed in these areas. There are a total of 551 wildlife sanctuaries in India.<br> These are the places where only wild animals can be found. Certain human activities like timber harvesting, cultivation, collection of woods, and other forest products are<br> permitted unless they interfere with the conservation project. Recreation tourism is also permitted.<br></div></div>


<b>Example-</b> Ghana Bird Sanctuary, Abohar Wildlife Sanctuary, Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, etc.

<b><li class="b">Biosphere reserves</li></b><br>
These are national governments nominated sites, large areas (often up to 5000 square km) of an ecosystem where the traditional lifestyle and natural habitat of the <br>inhabitants of that ecosystem are protected. They are mostly open to tourists and researchers.<BR><BR></UL>


<b>Example-</b> Sundarban, Nanda Devi, Nokrek, and Manas in India.</P1>

  <div class="c">  <h2 class="b">EX-SITU CONSERVATION</h2><P2><BR>
    Ex-situ conservation of biodiversity involves the breeding and maintenance of endangered species in<BR> artificial ecosystems such as zoos, nurseries, botanical gardens, gene banks, etc. There is less competition for food, water and space among the organisms.
    
    Ex-situ conservation has the following advantages:
    <OL>
    <LI>The animals are provided with a longer time and breeding activity.</LI><BR>
    <LI>The species bred in captivity can be reintroduced in the wild.</LI><BR>
    <LI>Genetic techniques can be used for the preservation of endangered species.</LI><BR></OL></P2></div>
