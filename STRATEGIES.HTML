    <h2>Biodiversity Conservation Strategies</h2>
    <ul>
   <p1><li><b>Conservation of Ecosystems-</b> The intent of the conservation of biodiversity is to provide long term viability to the ecosystems. It is to make sure that ecological integrity is intact.<br> The landscapes of the region which have undergone historical or evolutionary deterioration can be reinstated. The threats can be removed and the ecosystems should be able<br> to continue with ecological processes. </li><br>
   <li><b>Reverse the decline of species-</b> According to this strategy, the aim of conservation is to restore the population of declined species in a particular ecosystem. </li><br>
   <li><b>Conservation of all biological aspects-</b> This strategy aims at giving cover and conserving food, livestock, microbial population, agricultural stock including plants and animals.</li><br>

   <li>Efficient utilization of natural resources.</li><br>

   <li>Strict laws on deforestation and preventions of deforestation by every means.</li><br>

    <li>Poaching and killing animals in the wild should be prevented.</li><br>

    <li>Creating public awareness about conservation of biodiversity and its importance. </li><br>

    <li>Longer time and breeding activity of the animals are provided.</li><br>

    <li>The breeding of species in captivity is reintroduced in the wild.</li><br>

    <li>Genetic techniques are used to preserve endangered species.</li></ul></p1><br>
